			<h1>Infrastructure of Wellington</h1>
			<p>Infrastructure plays a key role in the operation of our city, connecting everything to a wider network from a single person to a whole city. There are markers and indicators of this infrastructure dotted around the city and its suburbs in many different forms, each linking us with a multitude of vital networks. We sometimes don't appreciate the vast structures that are situated above and below us, and how important these structures are in maintaining and meeting our daily demands.</p>

			<h1>Manhole Covers</h1>
			<p>Manholes are openings to a space that we don't usually recognise or consider in our day to day lives. Beneath us lies a vast network, making connections between us and countless other systems such as the water, sewerage, telephone, electric, heating and gas services. The designs on these manhole covers often indicate what system they are connected to.</p>

			<p>These buried cable markers can be found scattered around streets the streets of Wellington. They are indicators of the cables below us that form various systems which play a crucial part in our lives. It is, again, a reminder of the interconnecting structures and systems that we don't see.
